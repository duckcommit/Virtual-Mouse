# Virtual Mouse (Computer Vision in Python)

This software is for lazy people like me who wants to control their device using their fingertips. This program allows you to control the mouse and left click by using your index and middle fingers. The technology used in this project is Python and OpenCV.

# Requirements

As of 1st February 2022, the Requirements are:
1) Python 3.8 or below.

2) OpenCV
OpenCV provides a real-time optimized Computer Vision library, tools, and hardware. You can install OpenCV by running this in the terminal:
```bash
  pip install opencv-python
```

2) Autopy
AutoPy is a simple, cross-platform GUI automation library for Python. You can install Autopy by running the following command in the terminal:
```bash
  pip install autopy
```

3) Mediapipe
MediaPipe is the simplest way for researchers and developers to build world-class ML solutions and applications for mobile, edge, cloud and the web. You can install Mediapipe by running the following command in the terminal:
```bash
  pip install mediapipe==0.8.8
```
Put both VirtualMouse2.py and Tracking.py in one folder and run VirtualMouse2.py.
